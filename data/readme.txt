gillettii_data_all.AN24.dadi		-SNP data formatted for input to dadi. Includes markers of all classes (synonymous, nonsynonmymous, UTR) and includes any SNP called in at least 6 individuals per population.
gillettii_data_syn.AN24.dadi		-Same as gillettii_data_all.AN24.dadi, but restricted to synonymous SNPs.
trinity_kmer31_assembly.fasta		-Transcriptome assembly generated by Trinity, combining data from all 16 individuals.
unified_genotyper_calls.vcf		-Filtered SNP calls for all 16 samples generated by GATK.  SNPs have been annotated with the info flag "EF=syn/ns/utr" to indicate the SNP class (syn=synonymous, ns=nonsynonymous, utr=untranslated).
